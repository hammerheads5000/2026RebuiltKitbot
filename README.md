# 2026RebuiltKitbot
The Hammerheads' (FRC Team 5000) code for the 2026 kitbot, and explanation on how it operates.

   So far, with this code, Kitbot can:
      -drive foward with 'a', backward with 'b'
      -spin clockwise with 'y' and counterclockwise with 'x'
      -drive using the joysticks
      -intake using the left trigger
      -shoot from farther away using the right trigger
      -shoot from close to the hub using the right bumper
   
   Kitbot uses BangBang and feedforward on the motor for shooting/intaking
   
   What needs testing/tuning:
       -nothing at this point
